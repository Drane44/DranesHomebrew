    <p>This item appears to be a longsword hilt.
While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to
cause a blade of pure energy to spring into existence, or
make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this
magic longsword shines a jade green light. If you are
proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are
proficient with the sun blade.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of
slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that
target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
</p>
    <p class="indent">The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-
foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. While
the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or
reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each,
to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet
each.</p>
